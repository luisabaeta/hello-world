testing github workflow
here is some text to test how changing stuff in a branch works within GitHub. 
Did you see I took the time to capitalize properly the letters of GitHub but not to start the sentence with an uppercase H?
I wonder if this says something about me. 
Probably it says more about github's branding. (I now refused to capitalise "github" on purpose). 
Is it even really spelled with a capital G and capital H or did I make this up?
Whateeeever. 
Anyway, that's it.
bye.
